A simple Weather App built using JavaScript, making use of the ACU Weather API.

You can search for any city (worldwide) and it displays the city name, the weather conditons, and the temperature. All in real-time. (Compliments to ACUWeather)

Some external resources for display, there are beatiful icons each specific to a weather condition, and two images constrasting between night and day.
